Contributions are welcome; feel free to submit a pull request. By doing so, you grant me a permanent, irrevocable license to use your code for any purpose I choose, as though I had written it myself. You retain the right to use your code for your own purposes as well, as though it had been independently written by both parties. In the event that Manifold grants any money to this project as a part of their [Community Fund](https://manifund.org/causes/manifold-community?tab=about), I will split that money among all contributers in approximate proportion to their contribution.

Please reach out to me on [Discord](https://discordapp.com/users/163751683837526016/), [Manifold](https://manifold.markets/IsaacKing), or [some other way](https://outsidetheasylum.blog/#contact) if you have any questions. I have very little experience with multi-person software development, so please don't hestitate to send advice and suggestions my way.
